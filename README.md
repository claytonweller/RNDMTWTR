# The Perfect Tweet

Live App- https://claytonweller.github.io/PerfectTweet/

## Marketing Description

_Give us any topic, and using the power of MACHINE LEARNING* we will create the perfect tweet!_
_It definitely won't be terrible..._
_Probably..._

* Absolutely no machine learning is used in this app

A perfect tweet isn’t made in a vacuum. It needs information and context to exist. We get as much context as possible by scraping not just 1 source, but 4! -

Wikipedia: Tweet smart. 
Twitter: Popular connetions. 
NewsAPI: Be current. 
Giphy: Catch the eye!

Then using a “sophisticated” Machine Learning*** algorithm, we will synthesize all of this data into a tweet that will make you laugh, cry, and hopefully change the world.
